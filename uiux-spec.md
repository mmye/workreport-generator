UI/UX Design Specification: Service Engineer Work Report Application
Document Overview
This document defines the UI/UX design and user flow for a work report application used by service engineers in the industrial machinery sector. The application provides a structured form-based report editor with two LLM-powered assistance features: Review (gap detection and improvement suggestions) and Polishing (readability enhancement). This document covers interaction design, layout, state management, and user flows. Technology and library choices are left to the implementer.


1. Core Design Principles
Principle
Description
Protect flow state
Never interrupt the writer mid-composition. All LLM feedback is triggered explicitly by the user.
Writer has final authority
Every LLM suggestion requires explicit acceptance. No silent auto-corrections.
Mode separation
"Writing" and "Reviewing/Polishing" are distinct modes the user consciously enters.
Minimal cognitive load
Service engineers return from field work fatigued. The UI must feel assistive, not supervisory.



2. Application Layout
2.1 Overall Structure
The main screen uses a two-pane layout:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Version Bar:  Draft v1  ●──○──○  v2  v3                    │

├──────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┤

│                              │                               │

│      INPUT PANE (main)       │     FEEDBACK PANEL (side)     │

│                              │                               │

│   Structured form fields     │   Review suggestion cards     │

│   organized by chapters      │   (only visible after review  │

│                              │    is triggered)              │

│                              │                               │

├──────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┤

│  Action Bar:  [📋 Request Review]   [✏️ Polish Text]         │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Input Pane (left/main): Always visible. Contains the structured report form.
Feedback Panel (right/side): Hidden or empty by default. Populated after a review is triggered.
Action Bar: Persistent bar housing the two primary LLM actions.
Version Bar (top): Displays the revision history as a horizontal progress indicator.
2.2 Input Pane: Structured Form
Reports are organized into predefined chapters, each containing multiple fields. Field types include:

Free-text areas (e.g., work description, findings, actions taken) — primary targets for LLM assistance
Structured fields (e.g., date/time, model number, serial number, client info) — not subject to LLM text transformation

Example chapter structure:

[Chapter 1] Work Overview

  ├─ Field: Date and Time (date picker)

  ├─ Field: Equipment Model (text input)

  ├─ Field: Purpose of Work (text area)

  └─ Field: Client Information (text input)

[Chapter 2] Inspection / Work Performed

  ├─ Field: Tasks Performed (text area)

  ├─ Field: Measurements and Results (text area)

  └─ Field: Parts Used (text area)

[Chapter 3] Abnormalities / Findings

  ├─ Field: Findings (text area)

  ├─ Field: Actions Taken (text area)

  └─ Field: Remaining Risks (text area)

[Chapter 4] Post-Work Confirmation

  ├─ Field: Verification Results (text area)

  └─ Field: Photo Attachments (file upload)

The exact chapter and field configuration is domain-specific and should be defined by the application administrator.


3. Feature 1: Review (Gap Detection and Improvement Suggestions)
3.1 Trigger
The user presses the [📋 Request Review] button in the Action Bar. There is no automatic or real-time review.
3.2 Suggestion Classification
Each suggestion generated by the LLM is classified along two dimensions:

By severity:

Level
Label
Criteria
Visual
🔴
Required
Safety-related omissions, mandatory fields left blank
Red accent
🟡
Recommended
Vague expressions, insufficient specificity
Yellow accent
🔵
Optional
Readability, terminology consistency
Blue accent


By operation type:

Type
Description
Example
Replace
Rewrite existing text
"No issues" → "Visual inspection revealed no abnormalities"
Insert
Add missing content to a field
"Post-action verification results are missing"
Flag
Attention needed, but no specific rewrite proposed
"'High temperature' — a specific value (e.g., 85°C) would improve reliability"
Cross-field
Inconsistency between two or more fields
"Findings mentions 'bearing noise' but Actions Taken is empty"

3.3 Feedback Panel: Card Layout
Each suggestion is rendered as a card in the Feedback Panel.
3.3.1 Card Anatomy
┌─ 🔴 Required ────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                    │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
3.3.2 Display Variations by Operation Type
Replace type — Show a diff between current text and proposed text:

Suggestion:

  After action, ─no issues─.

  After action, ＋manual operation of all axes was＋

  ＋performed and confirmed normal.＋

Use sentence-level diff (not word-level; word-level is hard to read in Japanese).
Color-code: red for deletions, green for additions.

Insert type — Show the target field and insertion point:

📍 [Ch.3] Actions Taken (append to end)

Suggestion: "After corrective action, manual operation..."

Flag type — No proposed text. Only a navigation action:

📍 [Ch.2] Measurements and Results

💡 "High temperature" — providing a specific value

   (e.g., 85°C) would improve report reliability.

  [Go to Field]   [Dismiss]

Cross-field type — Link to multiple fields:

📍 [Ch.3] Findings ↔ [Ch.3] Actions Taken

⚠️ Findings mentions "bearing noise" but

   Actions Taken is empty.

  [Write Actions Taken]  [Edit Findings]  [Dismiss]
3.3.3 Card Sort Order
Cards are sorted by chapter order (matching the form top-to-bottom). Within the same chapter, sort by severity: 🔴 → 🟡 → 🔵. This allows the user to process suggestions sequentially by scrolling both panes in parallel.
3.3.4 Summary Bar
A summary bar is displayed at the top of the Feedback Panel:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 2 unresolved   ✅ 3 resolved   ✕ 1 dismissed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3.4 Input Pane: Field Indicators
After a review is executed, fields with suggestions receive visual indicators:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Actions Taken                         🔴 1   │  ← Badge on field label

│                                              │

│ No issues.                                   │

│                                              │  ← Left border colored by

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘     highest severity

Left border color indicates the highest severity among the field's suggestions.
The badge shows the count of active suggestions.
Clicking the badge scrolls to the corresponding card(s) in the Feedback Panel.
3.5 Bidirectional Navigation
Panel card click → Input Pane scrolls to the target field and highlights it.
Field badge click → Feedback Panel scrolls to the corresponding card(s).

This bidirectional link must be maintained at all times while review results are active.
3.6 Suggestion Application Flow
3.6.1 "Apply Suggestion" — Two-Step Confirmation
Pressing "Apply Suggestion" does not immediately commit the change. It enters a preview state within the field.

Step 1: Preview

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Actions Taken                     [Applying] │

│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐ │

│ │ After corrective action, manual          │ │  ← Proposed text with

│ │ operation of all axes was performed      │ │     highlight background

│ │ and confirmed normal.                    │ │

│ └──────────────────────────────────────────┘ │

│   [Confirm]   [Undo]                         │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The user may edit the proposed text directly in this preview before confirming.

Step 2: Confirm

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Actions Taken                           ✅   │  ← Badge changes to resolved

│                                              │

│ After corrective action, manual operation    │  ← Text committed as normal

│ of all axes was performed and confirmed      │     content

│ normal.                                      │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Rationale for two-step confirmation: Service engineers have domain-specific knowledge about the actual field conditions. The LLM's suggestion may need adjustment to match reality. The preview step provides an opportunity to refine the text before committing.
3.6.2 "Write Myself"
Focus moves to the target field. Cursor is placed at the appropriate position (end of field for Insert type; selection over the relevant passage for Replace type).
The corresponding card transitions to an "In Progress" state.
When the user moves focus away from the field, the card transitions to "Resolved."
3.6.3 "Dismiss"
The card grays out and collapses.
The field's badge count decrements; the badge and border are removed if no suggestions remain.
An optional (not required) input for the dismissal reason is shown.

   └─────────────┘   └──────────────┘
3.8 Review Completion and Re-Review
When all cards are in a terminal state (Applied, Resolved, or Dismissed):

Display a completion indicator: "Review complete."
Offer two actions: [Run Another Review] and [Proceed to Polish / Submit].

When re-review is triggered:

Previously dismissed suggestions with the same content are not re-displayed (dismissal history is retained).
New suggestions are displayed with a "NEW" badge.
The Version Bar advances (v1 → v2).


4. Feature 2: Text Polishing (Readability Enhancement)
4.1 Purpose and Scope
Polishing improves readability without altering factual content. It is a separate function from Review and operates on different principles:

Review = discrete, card-based suggestions about content gaps and improvements
Polishing = continuous, field-level text transformation for readability
4.2 Recommended Workflow Position
Writing → Review (content) → Fix suggestions → Polish (readability) → Submit

Polishing is recommended after Review because content changes during review would invalidate polishing results. However, the UI does not enforce this order — only guides it (see Section 4.8).
4.3 Polishing Levels
A slider control with 5 discrete levels:

 Minimal ──────────────●──────────── Maximum

   Lv1      Lv2      Lv3      Lv4      Lv5

Level
Label
Scope of Changes
Lv1
Typos only
Fix misspellings, typos, and kana errors. No structural changes.
Lv2
Normalize
Lv1 + unify inconsistent notation (e.g., variant kanji forms), normalize punctuation. Sentence meaning and order unchanged.
Lv3
Light edit
Lv2 + trim redundant expressions, fix particle usage. No sentence splitting or merging.
Lv4
Restructure
Lv3 + split overly long sentences, clarify subject-predicate relationships, convert passive to active voice. Sentence order unchanged.
Lv5
Full rewrite
Lv4 + reorder sentences, add/revise conjunctions, adjust paragraph structure.


Immutable elements across all levels:

Numeric values (measurements, temperatures, pressures, dates, times)
Model numbers, serial numbers, part numbers
Company names, personal names, equipment names
Quoted speech or instructions
Domain-specific technical terms
4.4 Polishing Trigger UI
Pressing [✏️ Polish Text] expands an inline settings panel below the Action Bar:

┌─ Polishing Settings ────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                          │

│  Level:                                                  │

│  [Typos]──[Normalize]──[Light edit]──[Restructure]──[Full] │

│     ○         ○            ●             ○          ○    │

│                                                          │

│  Scope:  ◉ All fields   ○ Selected fields only           │

│                                                          │

│                    [Run Polishing ▶]                      │

│                                                          │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

When "Selected fields only" is chosen, checkboxes appear on each text-area field in the Input Pane for the user to select targets.
4.5 Polishing Result Display: Inline Diff Mode
Unlike Review, polishing results are displayed inline within the Input Pane — not in the Feedback Panel. This is because polishing transforms the entire text of a field, making a side-by-side view within the field more natural than card-based presentation.
4.5.1 Field Preview Mode
After polishing runs, each affected field switches to a diff preview mode:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Tasks Performed                     Polish Lv3 Active │

│                                                      │

│  ─Performed visual and tap inspection on site today.─ │

│  ＋Visual and tap inspection was performed on site.＋  │

│                                                      │

│  ─As a result, no particular abnormalities were      │

│  ─found in each section, however, slight looseness   │

│  ─in the bearing cover was observed.─                │

│  ＋No abnormalities were found in any section.       │

│  ＋However, slight looseness was observed in the     │

│  ＋bearing cover.＋                                   │

│                                                      │

│  Model: XR-4500  Reading: 85°C   ← Unchanged (gray)  │

│                                                      │

│  [Confirm Polish]  [Change Level & Retry]  [Revert]   │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Display rules:

Sentence-level diff with color coding (red = removed, green = added).
Unchanged elements (numbers, proper nouns) are shown in gray to provide visual confirmation that protected content was not altered.
Each field has its own set of action buttons.
4.5.2 Per-Field Status Tracking
Each polished field independently tracks its own state:

[Ch.1] Work Overview           ✅ Polish confirmed

[Ch.2] Tasks Performed         🔍 Preview active     ← Currently viewing

[Ch.3] Findings                🔍 Preview active

[Ch.4] Post-Work Confirmation  ↩️ Reverted
4.6 Granular Change Selection (Advanced Mode)
For users who want partial acceptance of polishing results:

Default view: Simple full-text diff with bulk actions (Confirm / Revert).

Advanced view (toggled): Each individual change is presented with a checkbox.

│  ☑  "行なった" → "行った"                            │

│  ☑  "結果としては" → (removed)                       │

│  ☐  "とくに異常は認められなかったが、しかし"           │

│      → "異常は認められなかったが、"                    │

│  ☑  "ガタつきが若干見られた"                          │

│      → "若干のガタつきが見られた"                      │

│                                                      │

│  [Apply Selected]   [Apply All]   [Revert]            │

All checkboxes are ON by default. The user unchecks changes they want to reject.
A toolbar toggle labeled "Select individual changes" switches between simple and advanced views.
4.7 Re-Polishing with Different Level
When the user presses [Change Level & Retry]:

The polishing settings panel re-expands.
The user adjusts the slider and presses [Run Polishing ▶] again.
The diff is regenerated. The diff always compares against the original text, not against a previous polishing result.

This ensures the user always sees the total delta from their original writing, regardless of how many times they adjust the level.
4.8 Interaction with Review
4.8.1 Recommended Flow (Review → Polish)
When all review cards are resolved/dismissed and the user triggers polishing, no special handling is needed.
4.8.2 Polishing with Unresolved Review Suggestions
If the user triggers polishing while unresolved review suggestions remain, display a warning dialog:

┌─ Confirmation ──────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                  │

│ ⚠️ There are 3 unresolved review suggestions.    │

│ It is recommended to resolve review suggestions  │

│ before polishing.                                │

│                                                  │

│   [Return to Review]    [Polish Anyway]          │

│                                                  │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

If the user proceeds with "Polish Anyway":

Polishing runs on the current text.
After polishing is confirmed, review suggestions are re-evaluated automatically.
Suggestions that are now satisfied by the polished text are auto-closed.
Suggestions that still apply have their field references re-mapped to the updated text.


5. Protected Terms Configuration
A settings interface allows users or administrators to define terms that the LLM must not modify during polishing.

┌─ Polishing Policy ────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                        │

│ 🔒 Never modified by polishing:                        │

│  • Numeric values (measurements, temperature, etc.)    │

│  • Model numbers, serial numbers, part numbers         │

│  • Company names, personal names, equipment names      │

│  • Quoted speech or instructions                       │

│  • Domain-specific technical terms                     │

│                                                        │

│ ⚙️ Custom protected terms:                             │

│  [+ Add]  valve seat grinding, dial gauge, ...         │

│                                                        │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

These custom terms supplement the LLM's built-in protection rules and are essential for preserving industry-specific jargon that may not appear in standard dictionaries.


6. Version Management
6.1 Version Bar
A horizontal indicator at the top of the screen tracks the report's revision history:

Draft v1  ●───●───○  v2  v3

A new version is created each time a Review cycle is completed (all cards resolved/dismissed).
Polishing confirmation within a version does not increment the version — it is part of the current revision.
6.2 Version Comparison
Clicking any version node opens a read-only diff view comparing that version to the current state. This allows the user to see cumulative changes and provides a sense of progress.
6.3 Suggestion Count Trend
Optionally display the number of review suggestions per version to show improvement:

v1: 🔴3 🟡5 🔵2  →  v2: 🔴0 🟡2 🔵1  →  v3: 🔴0 🟡0 🔵0 ✅

Reaching zero suggestions serves as a natural "ready to submit" signal.


7. Submission Gate
Before final submission, display a pre-submission checklist:

✅ All required (🔴) review suggestions resolved
✅ No mandatory fields are empty
✅ Photo attachments present (if required by report type)
⚠️ Optional: Polishing has been applied (informational, not blocking)

Blocking items (🔴 unresolved, mandatory fields empty) prevent submission. Other items are warnings only.


8. Edge Cases and Special Behaviors
Scenario
Behavior
User manually edits a field after applying a suggestion
Applied status is retained. Changes are re-checked on next Review.
Multiple suggestions target the same field
Cards are displayed individually. If applying one invalidates another, dependent cards are auto-dismissed with a note.
Insert suggestion targets an empty field
Instead of a preview overlay, the proposed text is inserted in an editable draft state (pre-filled but not yet confirmed).
LLM suggestion is inappropriate
"Dismiss" with optional reason. Reason data can be collected for model improvement.
Re-review after polishing
Polished text is treated as the new baseline. Previous dismissals still apply.
User changes polishing level mid-preview
Previous polishing result is discarded. New diff is generated against the original (pre-polish) text.
Field has both active review suggestion and polishing preview
Review suggestions take precedence. Polishing preview is suppressed for that field until review suggestions are resolved.
